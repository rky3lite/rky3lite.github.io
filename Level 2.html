      <h3>Level 2: Intermediate Level</h3>
     <p>The student will learn how to more deeply apply their skills in Ableton Live. They will do this by learning more about various implements such as audio effects, MIDI effects, and automation, while also learning more about conventional chord and note progressions, going into signal flow, and recordingvocals as a foundational point for recording other instruments. The student will also learn how vocals differ from other instruments. They will also learn maintenance techniques with Ableton, so that they can set up their DAW to the way they want it and import sample libraries. </p>
