     <p>This is a curriculum guide to explain the various lessons and skill levels in the Digital Music Learning curriculum for Ableton Live. I devised four skill levels for Ableton Live, going from the lowest familiarity to the highest familiarity level. Each video builds off of the skills taught in the last, as this is designed to be an asynchronous curriculum that one can learn from anywhere, at any time. The videos can also be viewed as “one-offs” as they each cover individual skillsets in digital music, however this is not reccomended; feel free to do this at your own discretion.
    </p>
     <br>           
     <p>The curriculum is primarily based on the principles of Music Production and Sound Engineering however it also covers music theory principles by extension. Its aim is to make music production knowledge more accessible and mainstream using asynchronous teaching through sites such as Khan Academy and similar. This course was designed so that anyone can learn the software, so we primarily cover Ableton’s internal features; only requires a laptop with 8 GB of RAM and a working microphone to complete the course. We do not put much emphasis on external equipment such as VSTs (unless they are free), MIDI equipment, audio interfaces, and external microphones as not all students will have these available. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The student can determine what skill level that they would be in either by their own intuition, or by taking the Digital Music Skills Quiz, a 24-question algorithmic method of assessing skill levels.</p>
