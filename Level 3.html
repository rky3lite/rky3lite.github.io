      <h3>Level 3: Advanced Level</h3>
      <p>Level 3 builds off of the skills learned in Level 2. By this point, the student is expected to have developed a solid understanding of workflow in Ableton so that they can learn more advanced techniques. They will learn to make songs using only the arrangement or session view, in order to help them see other ways of productively making music. They will also learn about developing sample libraries, using VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugins, important mixing effects like EQ (equalizers) and compression, working with grooves in samples, and the warp feature in Ableton Live. The series also has a lesson on setting up and using external MIDI and audio equipment, which is recommended for all students regardless of whether they have that equipment themselves.</p>
     <br><p><em>(Note: A VST is an external plugin that offer more samples and instruments, audio and MIDI effects, mixing and mastering software, etc than Abletonâ€™s baseline software)</em></p>
      <h5>Lessons to expect:</h5>
     <p>3-01: Song Construction only using Session View
       <br>3-02: Song Construction only using Arrangement view
       <br>3-03: External VSTs like Autotune
       <br>3-04: Samples and Sample Libraries
       <br>3-05: Using EQ and Compression with Mixing
       <br>3-06: Grooves in Audio
       <br>3-07: Ableton's Warp Feature
     </p>
