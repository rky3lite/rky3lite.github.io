      <h3>Level 4: Expert Level</h3>
      <p>Level 4 builds off of the skills learned in Level 3, Level 2, and Level 1. The student is expected to have mastered the skills learned thus far. The lessons cover highly advanced skills such as mixing a song fully, writing musical pieces quickly by combining audio samples with MIDI note patterns, songwriting, mastering, and others. By the end of the series, students will be completely fluent in creating digital pieces on their own. The course will also introduce students to Max MSP, the programming language that can be used to make audio and MIDI effects and plugins for Ableton Live (Note: the Max for Live lesson is a one-off lesson, as this curriculum is more contingent on music production, Music Theory, and sound engineering skills) This is also the end of the Ableton series (Note: this is only as of now), however if students want to learn more, they can find other resources.</p>
     <h5>Lessons to expect:</h5>
     <p>4-01: Mixing a song
       <br>4-02: Enhanced workflow
       <br>4-03: Quick Mastering in Ableton
       <br>4-04: How to improve your mixing and mastering 
       <br>4-05: Max for Live
       <br>4-06: Songwriting Instrumentals 
       <br>4-07: Foley 
     </p>
     <h3>Level 4 videos are coming soon!</h3>

     <p><em>(Note: All lessons after 4-04 are considered “extra credit” material as they deviate from the baseline curriculum. It is recommended for students to learn them regardless.)</em></p>
